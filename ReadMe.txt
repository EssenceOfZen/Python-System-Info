This program was created with learning (for myself) and teaching (others) to utilize python's modules such as sys, os, and ctypes to read the system's info and will later create a log file.

Future plans for this program is to allow:
	* The user to change directories 
	* Create/Delete/Rename files
	* List envrionement variables
	* Manipulate envrionment variables
	* Act as a module for future projects
	* Add a GUI version
